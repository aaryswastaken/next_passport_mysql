# This repo is based on [this example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-passport)

But implement mysql-based account storage. (And maybe in the future an authentication manager based on redis)

## This is a training repo so I can exercise on : 
 - Next.js
 - SQL
 - Node.js
 - Jest / unit tests

So be aware that this repo is **not** (and probably will neither be) documented in any way but feel free to discuss 
with the discussion tab.
